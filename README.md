# media-marketing-lfm-puntenberekening

A simple web tool built for the League FM Media & Marketing team to calculate points based on the number of Discord servers contacted. The tool allows users to input the number of servers and get the corresponding points based on predefined rules. The interface is designed with a clean and modern look, incorporating minimal animations and a color scheme aligned with League FM's branding. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
